# BiomedSciAI 
## 🙋‍♀️ What is BiomedSciAI?

Our mission is to accelerate scientific discovery in Biomedical Sciences through
 a variety of tools that can help scientists do their research quicker and more 
 effectively.

Whether you use population-scale data like EHRs, subcellullar-scale data like 
spatially resolved omics, or a combination of various modalities, we host tools 
that will help you make the most out of it. 

## 🌈 How can I get involved?

If you want to contribute and get involved check out the guidelines 
of the repository of your interest and our [code of conduct](code_of_conduct.md).

## 👩‍💻 How can I use it?

We are just getting started but there is already plenty of stuff you can do with
BiomedSciAI.

A good starting point is to check out the pinned repositories. You can find all 
implementation details and some examples in the docs.

Try out the example repositories that we prepared for various applications.
